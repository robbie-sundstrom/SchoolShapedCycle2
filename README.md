This is our work from Cycle 2 of our OSS with School Shaped. 


To run, follow the steps below:

1. Initialize it as a heroku project
  - `heroku login`
  - `heroku create`

2. Send the heroku project to heroku’s servers and view it online
  - `git push heroku master`
  - `heroku open`

3. Install the project’s dependencies and run the project on your local servers
  - `npm install`
  - `heroku local web`
  - check out http://localhost:5000

We used the template at https://github.com/zsobin/DemoWebApp as the structural base for our web app.
